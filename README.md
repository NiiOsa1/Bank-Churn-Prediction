# Bank Churn Prediction

This project predicts customer churn for a bank using machine learning models. The goal is to identify at-risk customers and suggest interventions to improve retention.

## Project Overview
- **Problem:** Businesses like banks must address the issue of customer churnâ€”when customers leave for another provider.
- **Objective:** Understand the factors that influence customer churn and develop predictive models.
- **Solution:** Use machine learning models to predict churn and guide business decisions.

## Project Structure
- **`data/`:** Contains raw and processed datasets.
- **`notebooks/`:** Jupyter notebooks for analysis and modeling.
- **`src/`:** Python scripts for data preprocessing, feature engineering, and modeling.
- **`reports/`:** Generated visualizations and summaries.

## Tools and Libraries
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries Used:** pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn
- **Development Environment:** Jupyter Notebook, VS Code

## How to Run the Project
1. Clone the repository to your computer:
