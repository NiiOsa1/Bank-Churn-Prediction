## Project Overview
- **Problem:** Businesses like banks must address the issue of customer churnâ€”when customers leave for another provider.
- **Objective:** Understand the factors that influence customer churn and develop predictive models.
- **Solution:** Use machine learning models to predict churn and guide business decisions.
